To get started, simply pull the Docker image and run it, pointing to a directory of OSCAL content in JSON format:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/easydynamics/oscal-editor-all-in-one
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v "$(pwd)"/oscal-content:/app/oscal-content ghcr.io/easydynamics/oscal-editor-all-in-one
```
See the [all-In-one deployment](all-in-one) documentation for more details.
